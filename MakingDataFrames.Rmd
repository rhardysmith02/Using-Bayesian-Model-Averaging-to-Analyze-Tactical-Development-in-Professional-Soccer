```

Packages

```{r packages, include=FALSE}

```

Loading merged_df

```{r}
merged_df <- read.csv("merged_df.csv")
merged_df <- merged_df[, !names(merged_df) %in% "X"]
```

Splitting into positional based data frames

```{r}
defenders <- filter(merged_df, Pos == 1)
midfielders <- filter(merged_df, Pos == 2)
forwards <- filter(merged_df, Pos == 3)
```

Clean out redundant/irrelevant/correlated variables

```{r}
defenders <- defenders %>% select (-c(Min, Nineties, MnPerMatch, MnPerStart, MnPerSub, MinPerc, Compl, Subs, unSub, Gls, Ast, GA, GminPK, GPKperNine, PK, PKatt, xG, npxG, xAG, npxGxAG, xGxAG, Sh, SoT, GPerS, GPerSoT, Touches, LiveTch, AttDrib, Succ, SuccPerc, Tkld, TkldPerc, Mis, Dis, CmpTotal, AttTotal, CmpShort, AttShort, CmpMed, AttMed, CmpLong, AttLong, FKPass, Sw, TI, CK, In, Out, Str, OffPass, PassBlock, Tkl, TklW, Int, LostTkl, BlockSh, Won, Lost, SCA, GCA, PassLiveSCA, PassDeadSCA, TOSCA, ShSCA, FldSCA, DefSCA, PassLiveGCA, PassDeadGCA, TOGCA, ShGCA, FldGCA, DefGCA, onG, onGA, PlusMinus, PMperNine, OnOff, ExpOnOff, TwoCrdY, Off, Player, Born, Comp, Pos, FKShot, FKPass, PKwon))
```

Write to csv

```{r}
write.csv(defenders, '~/Desktop/Senior Seminar/defenders.csv')
```
